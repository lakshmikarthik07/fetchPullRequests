# fetchPullRequests
Fetch and display data from the GitHub API List PRs in the repo. You might want to show only open PRs. When a PR is selected, show the diffs for it. This should be the aggregate diffs of the whole PR, not broken down by commit. The diff should be a side-by-side style, similar to “Split” the way Github displays diffs. Use native Android (Java or Kotlin), not webview’s, javascript, etc. You can hard-code the app to point to any public repo you choose.
