#Challenge

 Our team uses GitHub for our code repository and code review. GitHub also allows you to follow your favorite open-source repositories to watch how the codebase is changing. For this exercise, we’d like you to build an Android app that shows Pull Requests (PRs) on a given repo. The main purpose of the app is to view the source changes (aka “diffs”) associated with the PRs. How you choose to build the app (interface and experience-wise) is up to you.

#This app should:

Fetch and display data from the GitHub API List PRs in the repo.
You might want to show only open PRs. When a PR is selected, show the diffs for it. This should be the aggregate diffs of the whole PR, not broken down by commit.
The diff should be a side-by-side style, similar to “Split” the way Github displays diffs.
Please post your code in a GitHub repo that we can access and share the link with me. We’ll look at your commit history to see your development story.


#looking for/grading on your ability to:

Interface with a REST API, given the docs
Program a nice looking, compelling UI
Handle any trickiness or math involved in a side-by-side diff GUI
